# Odin Arcade

A repository of small, functional but incomplete classic arcade games rebuilt
with Odin and Raylib. The idea came during an especially long and boring train
ride, to see if I could build a somewhat functional breakout clone in a handful
of hours.

## Games
- **Breakout**
- More might be coming with more travel time ;)

## Installation

You'll need [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) installed. Raylib is bundled with Odin in the vendor folder.
Then just clone this repo and run:

```bash
cd breakout
odin run .
```

## Notes
These are intentionally simple implementations focusing on core game mechanics rather than polish. 
Perfect for train rides or lazy weekends when you want to code something fun without overthinking it.
